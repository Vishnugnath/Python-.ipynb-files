        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A context manager in Python is a construct that allows you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most common use case for a context manager is to handle resources like file streams, database connections, and locks in a way that ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. Context managers are typically used with the `with` statement."

When the `with` block is entered, the context manager’s `__enter__` method is called. When the block is exited, the context manager’s `__exit__` method is called, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not."
