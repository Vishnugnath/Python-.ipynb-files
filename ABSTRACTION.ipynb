        "Abstraction is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity by providing a simplified interface for interaction. In Python, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and abstract methods using the `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module."

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Abstract classes and methods contribute to abstraction by defining a common interface with abstract methods that must be implemented by any derived class. An abstract class cannot be instantiated on its own, and it provides a blueprint for other classes. Abstract methods are declared in the abstract class without implementation, forcing derived classes to provide specific implementations. This helps in enforcing a consistent interface and hiding complex implementation details."

        "Abstraction helps in software design by promoting modularity and encapsulation. It allows designers to focus on the high-level functionality of components without getting bogged down by implementation details. By using abstract classes and methods, developers can create a clear contract for how different parts of the system interact, improving maintainability and flexibility. Abstraction also enables code reusability and separation of concerns, making the system easier to understand and manage."

However, some level of abstraction can be achieved without inheritance through other techniques such as interfaces, function decorators, or by simply defining functions that encapsulate specific behaviors. But for a full OOP approach, inheritance and abstract classes are commonly used to enforce abstraction."
