        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (the child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent class). This mechanism promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. In Python, inheritance is implemented by passing the parent class as an argument to the definition of the child class."

This allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, combining their functionalities.

It is often used to ensure that the initialization of the parent class is properly done when the child class is instantiated. `super()` helps to avoid explicit references to the parent class and makes the code more maintainable, especially in complex inheritance hierarchies."
