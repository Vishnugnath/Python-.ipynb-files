        "Answer:\n",
        "Polymorphism is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function, method, or operator to operate differently based on the type of object or data it is applied to. This promotes flexibility and the ability to use a unified interface to interact with different types of objects."

By overriding special methods such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__`, you can define custom behavior for these operators based on the class."

        "Compile-time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism) is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods have the same name but different signatures. Python does not support method overloading as it uses dynamic typing. Runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism) is achieved through method overriding, where a method in a child class overrides a method in the parent class, and the method to be invoked is determined at runtime."

This allows a client class to choose an algorithm at runtime without altering the clientâ€™s code.
