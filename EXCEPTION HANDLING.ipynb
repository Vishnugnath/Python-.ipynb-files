        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Exception Handling is a mechanism in Python that allows a program to deal with runtime errors gracefully. Instead of crashing the program, Python provides a way to catch and handle errors that occur during the execution of the program. This is done using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains code that may raise an exception, the `except` block contains code to handle the exception, `else` runs if no exception occurs, and `finally` runs code that needs to execute regardless of whether an exception occurred."

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The `try` block contains code that might cause an exception. If an exception occurs, Python stops executing the code in the `try` block and jumps to the `except` block. The `except` block contains code that handles the exception. If no exception occurs, the `except` block is skipped."
