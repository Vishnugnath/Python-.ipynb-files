## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with a wide range of Python concepts. Each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in this repository covers a specific topic and includes five questions that test your understanding of that topic. The questions are followed by detailed answers to help reinforce your learning.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-concepts-qa.git
   cd python-concepts-qa
   ```

2. **Open Jupyter Notebooks:**
   - Ensure you have Jupyter installed. You can install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```
   - Open the notebooks by running:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Navigate to the desired notebook and start practicing.

3. **Explore the Questions and Answers:**
   - Each notebook is self-contained and covers a specific topic. Open the notebook corresponding to the topic you're interested in, and work through the questions. The answers are provided to help you understand the concept better.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic understanding of Python programming
